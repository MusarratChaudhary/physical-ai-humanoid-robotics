# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Principles for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics:**
1. All content must be technically accurate and based on current best practices in ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo/Unity, and VLA models as of 2025
2. Use Docusaurus exclusively for the site – no alternatives
3. Favor MDX for rich content: executable code snippets, Mermaid diagrams, embedded demos
4. Structure strictly follows the 4 modules + intro + capstone
5. Every module must include: Theory, Tools/Libraries, Hands-on Labs, Challenges, and Quiz/Reflection questions
6. Emphasize embodied intelligence, physical laws, and safe human-robot interaction
7. Code examples must be runnable, well-commented, and use Python where possible
8. Site must be SEO-friendly, fast-loading, and include versioned docs
9. Never introduce unrequested features; stay faithful to the course outline
10. Output only clean, production-ready Markdown/MDX files compatible with Docusaurus

**Verification:**
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified for robotics/AI concepts
- [ ] Docusaurus implementation confirmed
- [ ] MDX usage planned for interactive content
- [ ] Module structure alignment confirmed
- [ ] Educational content requirements addressed
- [ ] Embodied intelligence focus maintained
- [ ] Code examples will be runnable and well-documented
- [ ] Performance and SEO requirements considered
- [ ] Scope fidelity maintained
- [ ] Production-ready output planned

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
