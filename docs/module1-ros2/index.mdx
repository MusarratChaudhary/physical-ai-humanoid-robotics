# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of our comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. In this module, we'll explore the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for modern robotic platforms.

## Introduction

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides libraries, tools, and conventions to simplify the development of complex robotic applications. It's designed to support the development of large-scale, distributed robotic systems with real-time performance requirements.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:

- **Introduction to ROS 2**: Understanding the evolution from ROS 1 and the key improvements in ROS 2
- **ROS 2 Theory and Architecture**: Deep dive into the DDS-based communication layer and middleware
- **Key Concepts**: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Parameters, and Packages
- **Tools & Libraries**: Essential tools for development, debugging, and visualization
- **Challenges & Debugging**: Common issues and best practices for troubleshooting
- **Safety Considerations**: Best practices for safe robot operation
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises to apply your knowledge

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the architecture and design principles of ROS 2
- Be able to create and manage ROS 2 packages, nodes, and communication patterns
- Know how to use essential ROS 2 tools for development and debugging
- Appreciate the safety considerations when working with robotic systems
- Have practical experience with ROS 2 through hands-on labs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of Linux command line operations
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)

Let's begin our journey into the world of ROS 2!
