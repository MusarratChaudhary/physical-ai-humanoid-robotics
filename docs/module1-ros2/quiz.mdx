## Short Answer Questions

### Question 11
Explain the publish-subscribe communication pattern in ROS 2 and provide an example of when it would be appropriate to use this pattern in a humanoid robotics application.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The publish-subscribe pattern in ROS 2 allows nodes to communicate asynchronously through topics. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics without direct connections between them. This pattern is appropriate for continuous data streams like sensor data (e.g., IMU readings, camera images, or joint states) where multiple nodes might need to consume the same data simultaneously.
</details>

### Question 12
What are the key differences between services and actions in ROS 2? When would you use each?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Services provide synchronous, request-response communication, ideal for short operations where a client sends a request and waits for a response. Actions are used for long-running tasks that may provide feedback during execution and support goals, results, and cancellation. Use services for quick operations like setting parameters or requesting robot state, and use actions for complex tasks like navigation or manipulation that take time to complete.
</details>

### Question 13
Describe the role of Quality of Service (QoS) policies in ROS 2 and explain why they are important for humanoid robotics applications.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
QoS policies in ROS 2 allow you to configure how messages are delivered in terms of reliability, durability, history, and other characteristics. They are important for humanoid robotics because different types of data have different requirements. For example, control commands require reliable delivery to ensure safety, while sensor data might use best-effort delivery to reduce latency. QoS policies ensure that the communication system meets the specific requirements of different robotic subsystems.
</details>

### Question 14
What are the main safety considerations when developing ROS 2-based humanoid robotic systems?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Key safety considerations include: implementing layered safety approaches (hardware, firmware, ROS nodes, application), using appropriate QoS settings for safety-critical communication, implementing emergency stop systems, validating parameters to prevent dangerous values, monitoring system states for safety violations, testing in simulation before hardware deployment, and maintaining safety documentation and procedures.
</details>

### Question 15
Explain the concept of lifecycle nodes in ROS 2 and why they are important for safety-critical applications.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Lifecycle nodes in ROS 2 follow a defined state machine with states like unconfigured, inactive, active, and finalized. They provide a structured way to initialize, configure, activate, deactivate, and clean up resources. They are important for safety-critical applications because they ensure proper initialization of safety systems, controlled activation of potentially dangerous functions, and proper cleanup of resources, reducing the risk of unsafe states.

## Programming Questions

### Question 16
Write a Python ROS 2 node that publishes a "Hello, World!" message to a topic called "greetings" every 2 seconds.

<details>

        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'greetings', 10)
        timer_period = 2  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello, World! {self.i}'

        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

class GreetingSubscriber(Node):
    def __init__(self):

        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'greetings',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info(f'I heard: "{msg.data}"')

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    greeting_subscriber = GreetingSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(greeting_subscriber)
    greeting_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

    main()
