# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Bringing Physical AI to Life

Welcome to the capstone project of this course, where we integrate all the concepts learned across the four modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot capable of understanding voice commands, planning actions, navigating environments, and manipulating objects in the physical world.

### Project Overview

In this comprehensive project, you'll build an intelligent humanoid robot system that demonstrates the convergence of:

- **Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: For communication and coordination between robot components
- **Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: For simulation and testing of robot behaviors
- **AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: For perception, decision-making, and control
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: For understanding human commands and executing appropriate actions

### Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will:

- Integrate multiple robotics frameworks and AI systems into a cohesive whole
- Implement voice command processing using OpenAI Whisper
- Design and implement LLM-based cognitive planning for complex tasks
- Develop navigation and manipulation capabilities for real-world interaction
- Test and evaluate the performance of your autonomous humanoid system
- Understand safety considerations when deploying AI-powered robots

### Project Structure

This capstone project is divided into several interconnected components:

1. [System Architecture](./system-architecture) - Understanding the overall design
2. [Voice Command Pipeline](./voice-command-pipeline) - Processing natural language commands
3. [LLM Planning](./llm-planning) - Translating high-level goals into executable actions
4. [Navigation & Manipulation](./navigation-manipulation) - Physical interaction with the environment
5. [Integration & Testing](./integration-testing) - Combining all components and testing
6. [Evaluation](./evaluation) - Assessing performance and capabilities

### Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Completed all four modules of this course
- Set up your development environment with ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac™, and required AI libraries
- Access to a humanoid robot platform (physical or simulated)
- Basic understanding of Python programming and robotics concepts

### Getting Started

Begin with the [System Architecture](./system-architecture) section to understand how all components work together, then proceed through each module in sequence to build your autonomous humanoid system.
