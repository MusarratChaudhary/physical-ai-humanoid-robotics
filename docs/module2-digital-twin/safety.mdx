# Safety in Simulation Environments

Safety is paramount in humanoid robotics, and simulation environments play a crucial role in ensuring safe robot operation. This section explores safety considerations specific to digital twin simulation, including virtual safety mechanisms, validation protocols, and safe transition strategies from simulation to reality.

## Virtual Safety Mechanisms
