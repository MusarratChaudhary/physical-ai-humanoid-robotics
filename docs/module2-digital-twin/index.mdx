# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics course. In this module, we'll explore the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on simulation environments that enable safe and efficient development of humanoid robots.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. In robotics, digital twins are essential for:

- Testing algorithms without risk to physical hardware
- Prototyping robot behaviors in safe environments
- Validating control systems before deployment
- Training AI models with synthetic data

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the principles of digital twin technology in robotics
- Gain hands-on experience with Gazebo and Unity simulation environments
- Learn to model humanoid robots in virtual environments
- Implement sensor simulation and data processing
- Develop safe testing protocols for robotic systems
